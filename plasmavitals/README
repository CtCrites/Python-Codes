This is a basic webscraper that will obtain donation history and vitals records from CSL Plasma's website. 
This data will then be saved in a csv file. The CSL Plasma website only reports the 20 most recent
donations. For this reason, the program will update the csv record if one already exists so as to
build a larger dataset over time.

The data collected is as follows:
  -Weight
  -Heart Rate
  -Blood Pressure
  -Temperature

The data is then reported in the form of a dashboard png with some stats.
